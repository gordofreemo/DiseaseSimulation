## Project Log 

### Andrew 
DONE:

- Made AgentManager class to handle initialization of Agents
- Agents appear to function, message sending/disease spreading works fine

TO DO: 

- Make the program be able to stop when running not in GUI form (it's likely that threads
are blocked waiting to read from the queue. )
